Tesla (the electric car company) is building a prototype for an AI salesperson. To do this, it needs you to code part of the flow of the initial conversation with the customer. The rules of the flow are as follow:
If the customer has previously bought a Tesla, and the customer is a US citizen, the AI should check how long ago the customer bought their Tesla
If the Tesla was bought four or more years ago, the AI should ask (console log) whether the customer would like an upgrade
Otherwise, it should ask whether the customer is satisfied with the car
If the customer is not as US citizen but has bought a Tesla, the AI should ask whether the customer would like to move to the US
If the customer has not bought a Tesla, the AI should ask whether they are interested in buying one
For the following task you are given these inputs from each customer:
let boughtTesla = true
const yearOfTeslaPurchase = 2014
let isUSCitizen = true
let currentYear = 2018
For your tests, change the values to make sure all the cases are working. For the above inputs, your AI prototype should output “Would you like an upgrade?”
